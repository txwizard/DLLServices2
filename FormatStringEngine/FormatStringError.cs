    Namespace:          WizardWrx.FormatStringEngine

    Class Name:         FormatStringError

    File Name:          FormatStringError.cs

    Synopsis:           This class organizes the details of a comprehensive
                        diagnostic message about an error in a format string.
                        The FormatStringParser exposes a List of these through a
                        FormatStringErrors property.

    Remarks:            The only externally visible parts of an instance of this
                        class are its ToString method, which overrides the base
                        class (object) method to return properties and labels as
                        a well formed CSV string, and a dedicated Split method,
                        meant to seriously discourage you from trying in vain to
                        use string.Split() to split it into its components.

    Date       Version By  Description
    ---------- ------- --- -----------------------------------------------------
    2014/07/19 1.0     DAG Initial implementation.

    2016/06/12 3.0     DAG Break the dependency on WizardWrx.SharedUtl2.dll,
                           correct misspelled words flagged by the spelling
                           checker add-in, and incorporate my three-clause BSD
                           license.

                           Reclassify this class as infrastructure, and mark it
                           Internal.

    2017/03/04 3.1     DAG Document the reason that the Split method raises a
                           warning about WizardWrx.AnyCSV.Parser.Parse having a
                           more restrictive build target (x86) than this library
                           (MSIL).

	2017/08/04 7.0     DAG Relocated to the constellation of core libraries that
                           began as WizardWrx.DllServices2.dll.
