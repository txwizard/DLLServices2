    Class Name:			DependentAssemblies

	File Name:			DependentAssemblies.cs

    Synopsis:			Instances of this class gather, sort, and process lists
                        of the dependents of an assembly.

	Remarks:			The Microsoft .NET Framework defers loading an assembly
						until one of public classes is referenced. However, once
						loaded, an assembly is never unloaded from the AppDomain
						into which it was loaded. 

						Hence, to generate a realistic report that reflects the
						assemblies that would actually load into a process, the
						dependent assemblies that have yet to see action must be
						explicitly loaded into an AppDomain.

						Since an assembly cannot be unloaded for the remaining'
						lifetime of the AppDomain into which it is loaded, the
						simplest solution is to load each assembly into its own
						private AppDomain. However, this is not straightforward,
						because a default assembly load puts copies in both the
						target AppDomain and the primary AppDomain. Since the
						Assembly class doesn't derive from MarshalByRefObject,
						this is accomplished by creating such an object, and
						letting it own the assembly reference.

						Finally, the MarshalByRefObject handle is unwrapped in
						the primary AppDomain, which gets access to the assembly
						through a factory method on the MarshalByRefObject.

    Algorithm:			Both constructors call a private initialization routine
                        that calls GetReferencedAssemblies on the assembly that
                        was stored into a private Assembly member. The output of
                        this method call is an array of AssemblyName objects
						that fully describe the dependent assemblies. Next, a
						generic List of DependentAssemblyInfo objects that has
						room for the same number of items is constructed and
                        populated by enumeration. Finally, the list is sorted,
                        AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies is called to get a
						list of the assemblies currently loaded into the primary
						AppDomain (Every process has a default AppDomain.), and
                        the resulting array is matched against the list of
						DependentAssemblyInfo objects to identify assemblies not
                        currently loaded.

						Each assembly that is not already loaded is loaded into
						a private AppDomain, and a reference to it is returned
						through a method and stored in the DependentAssemblyInfo
						list.

						To report the properties of the dependent assemblies,
						the DependentAssemblyInfo is enumerated once more, and
						the properties of each assembly are queried through the'
                        reference returned through one of its properties.
