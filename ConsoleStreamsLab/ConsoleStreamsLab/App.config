    File Name:          app.config for ConsoleStreamsLab.exe

    Synopsis:           Store settings for file names and other properties that
                        may require adjustments to conform to another user's
                        directory structure. This application has an active
						trace listener that expects to be able to write into a
						specific directory, which probably won't exist on any
						machine other than mine.

    Remarks:            Asterisks cannot be used as bullets in XML documents,
	                    nor can hyphens be used as section dividers.

    2017/04/04 DAG The build system generated a configuration file from inputs
                   to the Settings designer, to which I added the trace listener.
    2017/07/06 DAG Change the name of the trace listener output file from
	               ConsoleStreamsLab.LOG to ConsoleStreamsLab_TRACE.LOG.
