//  2015/06/04 5.4 Incorporate P6CUtilLib1.dll into the project, and mark it as

2015-06-04 18:46:48 - Resolve "Project file contains ToolsVersion="4.0". This
                      toolset may be unknown or missing, in which case you may
                      be able to resolve this by installing the appropriate
                      version of MSBuild, or the build may have been forced to a
                      particular ToolsVersion for policy reasons. Treating the
                      project as if it had ToolsVersion="12.0".

                      For more information, please see
                      http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=293424."

                      The ToolsVersion value of 4.0 is due to Visual Studio 2010
                      being the last to upgrade the project configuration file.
                      According to the article, the error is benign. Leaving it
                      preserves the option of opening the project in VS 2010.

                      Meanwhile, VS 2013 treats the project as if this value was
                      12.0, its native value.

I recently had this pop up on a .config file when I only  made text edits to it.
The only difference it made was when right clicking the file it then had the
context menu options added: "View Designer", "View Code".   They are totally
non-applicable to a .config file and clicking either of them accomplished
nothing.  I reverted the change to the .csproj file and everything was dandy.
I think that subtype makes good sense for certain kinds of files.  But it appears
there is a little bug in visual studio that sometimes causes it to apply
incorrectly.

Reference:  "What is <SubType>Designer</SubType> for in .csproj?"

Description

 Sometimes VS will needlessly change <Xml Include="file.xml" /> to <Xml Include="file.xml"><SubType>Designer</SubType></Xml> to my XML files in a utility project.  The "Show in Designer" context menu option is always disabled, so adding this XML to my project file just causes unwanted version control churn and adds no value.
