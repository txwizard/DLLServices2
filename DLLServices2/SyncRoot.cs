	Namespace Name:		WizardWrx.DLLServices2

	Class Name:			SyncRoot

	File Name:			SyncRoot.cs

	Synopsis:			This module contains the complete definition of a
						SyncRoot class, which provides a way to document a
						lock by giving it a displayable label.

	Dependencies:		This class uses only two base classes from the Microsoft
						.NET Framework Base Class Library, Object and String.

	Remarks:			1)	The default constructor generates an unlabeled lock
							object.

						2)	This class was defined and tested in the course of
							creating the TimeStampFactory class, which has since
							been moved to the WizardWrx.DateMath library, along
							with a private copy of this class.

							Putting a private copy of this class in library
							WizardWrx.DateMath avoids coupling that library to
							this one.

						3)	The label is made available as a public read-only
							property, but it can be set only by the constructor.

						For all practical purposes, this class is LockWithLabel,
						with a new name.

    Revision History
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Date       Author Synopsis
    ---------- ------ ----------------------------------------------------------
    2010/03/20 DAG    Initial version.
	2010/03/31 DAG    Merge into this library, and mark class public.
	2010/04/04 DAG    Supply missing XML documentation.
	2011/04/04 DAG    Unseal the class, so that other classes can inherit it.
	2015/06/20 DAG    Re-seal the class, having concluded that there is no good
                      reason that another class should be able to inherit it,
                      and leave the label uninitialized.
	2016/06/07 DAG    Adjust the internal documentation to correct a few
                      inconsistencies uncovered while preparing this library for
                      publication on GetHub.
