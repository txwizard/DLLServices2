    Namespace:          WizardWrx.DLLServices2

	File Name:			StateManager.cs

    Class Name:			StateManager

    Synopsis:			Maintain run-time information about the executing
						instance of the console application in a Singleton, so
						that it is readily accessible from any of its classes
						and methods.

    Remarks:			This class is a simplification of ApplicationInstance,
						which it supersedes. Methods and properties that are
						applicable only to a console mode applications were
						removed, and will resurface in a derived class, to be
						exported by the ConsoleAppAids2 class library, where
						they belong. This change is motivated by my desire to
						decouple this class library from ConsoleAppAids2.

						The Code Analysis Module raised two warnings about code
						in this module that I suspect would be truly difficult
						for a bad actor to leverage to cause harm. Regardless,
						I did my best to address both.

						1)	CA1404: Call GetLastError immediately after
								    P/Invoke.

							Having seen the disassembled native code generated
							to implement this method, it appears that this is
							unwarranted, and my code safely meets its design
							objective of skipping the call to GetLastError when
							its return value is meaningless,  and would be
                            ignored.

						2)	CA2122: Do not indirectly expose methods with link
								    demands.

							The method that calls Marshal.GetLastWin32Error
							raises this warning due to its link demand. The
							specified mitigation is to add an attribute,
							assembly: EnvironmentPermissionAttribute, with
							SecurityAction.RequestRefuse, Unrestricted = true.
						`	Since this prevented binding the library to other
							full trust assemblies, I did away with that, and
							settled for another attribute to suppress the
							warning.

						At long last, as of version 5.5, this assembly is
						completely independent of strong named assembly
						WizardWrx.SharedUtl2.dll.

    Revision History
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Date       Version Author Synopsis
    ---------- ------- ------ --------------------------------------------------
    2014/03/28 4.0     DAG    Create this class by removing the methods and
                              properties that are meaningful only in a console
                              application from the ApplicationInstance class,
                              which remains, but is marked obsolete.

                              The following methods are moving to the derived
                              class.

                                  DisplayBOJMessage
                                  DisplayEOJMessage
                                  ErrorExit
                                  GetBOJMessage
                                  GetEOJMessage
                                  NormalExit

    2014/05/20 4.1     DAG    Since I finally have a working interface to the
                              GetExeSubsystem routine, use it to expose the
                              subsystem ID and string as a pair of properties.

                                  AppSubsystemID
                                  AppSubsystem

    2014/06/06 4.2     DAG    Class moved to library WizardWrx.DLLServices2, but
                              kept its position in the namespace hierarchy.

    2014/06/21 5.1     DAG    Correct an oversight that left this class in the
                              old WizardWrx.ApplicationHelpers namespace. Since
                              this change affects only two other DLLs, and, at
                              most one user program, I took advantage of the
                              opportunity to hoist the DLLServices2 namespace to
                              the first rank under the overall WizardWrx
                              namespace.

    2015/06/05 5.4     DAG    Allow the Code Analysis module to add attribute
                              System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessage to
                              the InitializeOnFirstUse method, to suppress a
                              warning that the method doesn't call GetLastError
							  immediately upon returning from the indirect
                              P/Invoke call, P6CUtilLib1.GetExeSubsystem. The
                              method is designed so that GetLastError is skipped
                              when the value returned by GetExeSubsystem meets
                              the test in the IF statement that processes the
                              value returned by IP6CUtilLib1.GetExeSubsystem and
                              GetLastError would always return a meaningless
                              ERROR_SUCCESS.

    2015/07/10 5.5     DAG    Update this internal documentation, adding details
                              such as the namespace that were omitted, and make
                              the format consistent with that of the flower
                              boxes in the other modules of this library, and
                              make the registered event source stored in the
                              exception logger accessible through a read-only
                              property.

	2015/09/01 5.6     DAG    Correct syntax errors and other issues in the XML
                              documentation.

	2015/09/01 5.7     DAG    Add a very simple product name and version format.

	2015/10/18 5.8     DAG    1) GetStdHandleFQFN is a method that returns the
                                 absolute (fully qualified) file name to which a
                                 standard console stream is redirected, if any.

                              2) FormatSystemErrorMessage is a convenience
                                 method that constructs a Win32Exception
                                 exception, from which it returns the Message
                                 property, which is equivalent to calling the
                                 FormatMessage Windows API routine on the system
                                 status code.

                              3) StandardHandleState tests the subsystem type,
                                 and reports an error unless the code is running
                                 in the character mode subsystem. Adding this
                                 test makes it safe to leave this routine in
                                 in this DLL, although, strictly speaking, it
                                 should go into WizardWrx.ConsoleAppAids2, but
                                 keeping it here slightly decreases the overhead
                                 of the required platform invoke calls and
                                 marshaling of unmanaged resources.

                              4) GetAppSubsystemID is a method that returns the
                                 AppSubsystemID as a IP6CUtilLib1.PESubsystemID.

	2016/04/06 6.0     DAG    System.Reference.Assembly.GetCallingAssembly takes
                              the place of System.Reflection.GetEntryAssembly to
                              make the behavior of this class consistent whether
                              or not it runs under the Visual Studio Hosting
                              process.

    2016/04/08 6.0     DAG    Replace the generic (C++ oriented) implementation
						      with an implementation optimized for the .NET
							  Framework, which eliminates the need for double-
							  checked locking in the constructor.

    2016/06/03 6.2     DAG    Minor documentation cleanup; code is unchanged.

	2016/06/06 6.3     DAG    Private ExceptionLogger method ReportAsDirected 
							  was printing twice on standard output unless that
                              stream was redirected. To prevent a disastrous
                              recursive calling loop, a new instance method,
                              GetStandardHandleStates, gets the standard handle
                              states from the StateManager, which calls this
                              method once both objects have been constructed.

							  Wile working on the ExceptionLogger improvements,
                              I noticed several optimizations that could improve
							  not only its constructor, but this one, too. These
                              improvements are especially pertinent in both of
                              these cases, because they eliminate unnecessary
                              expensive trips across the managed/unmanaged code
                              boundary to gather information inaccessible via
                              managed code, and fairly complex to obtain, even
                              via the Windows API.
