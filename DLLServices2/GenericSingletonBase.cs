	File Name:			GenericSingletonBase.cs

    Class Name:			GenericSingletonBase<T>

    Synopsis:			Maintain run-time information about the executing
						instance of the console application in a Singleton, so
						that it is readily accessible from any of its classes
						and methods.

    Remarks:			Sibling classes ExceptionLogger and StateManager are the
						first two concrete classes to inherit from this class.
						ConsoleAppStateManager, the singleton that motivated the
						research mentioned in the next paragraph, is the first
						class defined in a dependent assembly to be derived from
						this class.

						I've thought several times over the last few years that
						the Singleton design pattern probably lends itself to an
						implementation as an abstract base class, though it had
						not yet occurred to me to make it a Generic. Then, while
						I was investigating whether it was practical to inherit
						from sibling class StateManager, I read the article
						cited below.

	/// called more than once, no matter how many subsequent references to the
	/// class occur.
	/// 
	/// Taking advantage of these features of the framework eliminates the need
	/// for synchronization, and replaces a method call with a direct reference
	/// to the static read only property that returns a reference to the one and
