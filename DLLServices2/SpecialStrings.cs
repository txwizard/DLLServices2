    Namespace:          WizardWrx

    Class Name:         SpecialStrings

    File Name:          SpecialStrings.cs

    Synopsis:           Define a handful of frequently used fixed strings that
                        have precise contents that are constant irrespective of
                        culture, and can be challenging to input correctly when
                        needed.

	Remarks:            This class is one of a constellation of static classes
						that define a wide variety of symbolic constants that I
						use to make my code easier to understand when I need a
						refresher or am about to change it.

						This class implements a subset of the characters defined
                        in WizardWrx.MagicNumbers. Some of those constants,
                        especially those intended mainly for use with arrays and
                        lists, have moved into sibling classes in this library.

						The XML documentation in this class incorporates cross
						references to classes defined in other modules that are
						compiled into the same assembly. A couple of hours has
						yielded the following lessons.

						1)	You can refer to any other class in the assembly, if
							you fully qualify it with respect to the namespace
							declared at the top of the same source module.

						2)	All references are subject to the above rule:

								- Argument types used to disambiguate overloads
								- Method names
								- Argument types used to disambiguate overloads
								- Named constants

							Examples:

								These don't work.

									GetReservedErrorMessage(ErrorExitOptions)
									ExceptionLogger.GetReservedErrorMessage(ErrorExitOptions)
									ExceptionLogger.GetReservedErrorMessage(ExceptionLogger.ErrorExitOptions)
									ExceptionLogger.GetReservedErrorMessage(DLLServices2.ExceptionLogger.ErrorExitOptions)

								This works.

									DLLServices2.ExceptionLogger.GetReservedErrorMessage(DLLServices2.ExceptionLogger.ErrorExitOptions)

							Notwithstanding assertions in the documentation that
							these cross references respect using irectiv4es when
							resolving, it appears that this courtesy may exclude
							references to the current assembly (the one being
							built), which makes sense, upon reflection, since it
							is in a state of flux, and has yet to be persisted.

						3)	See and SeeAlso XML tags can refer to Web pages, but
							the correct keyword is not CREF, but HREF.
