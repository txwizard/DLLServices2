    Namespace:          WizardWrx

    Class Name:         MagicBooleans

    File Name:          MagicBooleans.cs

    Synopsis:           Define a handful of frequently used Boolean values whose
                        correct values are easier to remember with the help of a
                        mnemonic.

    Remarks:			This class implements all Boolean constants defined in
                        WizardWrx.MagicNumbers and exposed by class library
                        WizardWrx.SharetUtl2. Most of the other constants have
                        migrated to other classes in this library.

						As of version 6.3, all but the first two are synonyms
						of constants also in WizardWrx.DLLServices2.FileIOFlags;
                        they shall remain, at least for the time being, to avoid
						breaking existing code. However, thee definitions may be
						kept indefinitely, for the same reason that 
						DisplayFormats exists alongside NumericFormats.

						The XML documentation in this class incorporates cross
						references to classes defined in other modules that are
						compiled into the same assembly. A couple of hours has
						yielded the following lessons.

						1)	You can refer to any other class in the assembly, if
							you fully qualify it with respect to the namespace
							declared at the top of the same source module.

						2)	All references are subject to the above rule:

								- Argument types used to disambiguate overloads
								- Method names
								- Argument types used to disambiguate overloads
								- Named constants

							Examples:

								These don't work.

									GetReservedErrorMessage(ErrorExitOptions)
									ExceptionLogger.GetReservedErrorMessage(ErrorExitOptions)
									ExceptionLogger.GetReservedErrorMessage(ExceptionLogger.ErrorExitOptions)
									ExceptionLogger.GetReservedErrorMessage(DLLServices2.ExceptionLogger.ErrorExitOptions)

								This works.

									DLLServices2.ExceptionLogger.GetReservedErrorMessage(DLLServices2.ExceptionLogger.ErrorExitOptions)

							Notwithstanding assertions in the documentation that
							these cross references respect using irectiv4es when
							resolving, it appears that this courtesy may exclude
							references to the current assembly (the one being
							built), which makes sense, upon reflection, since it
							is in a state of flux, and has yet to be persisted.

						3)	See and SeeAlso XML tags can refer to Web pages, but
							the correct keyword is not CREF, but HREF.

	2015/06/23 5.5     DAG    Move the Boolean constants from StandardConstants,
                              and add a couple of new ones for use with the
                              static Enum.Parse method.
    2015/09/01 5.7     DAG    Correct spelling errors flagged by the spelling
                              checker add-in that I recently installed into the
                              Visual Studio 2013 IDE, along with a documentation
                              XML error that I overlooked.

	2016/06/04 6.2     DAG    Resolve ambiguous and unreachable cross references
							  tags in the XML documentation.
 
    2016/06/07 6.3     DAG    Correct technical errors uncovered while preparing
                              this library for publication on GitHub, and turn
                              the constants for working with streams into
                              synonyms of the constants in FileIOFlags, which
                              are slightly less accessible, since they belong to
                              a subsidiary namespace.
